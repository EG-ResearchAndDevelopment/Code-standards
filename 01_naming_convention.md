# 1. Naming Conventions

## 1.1. General

The naming convention is based on PEP-8. The following is a summary of the naming conventions. For more information, please refer to the [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) document. 
* Avoid using names that are too general or too wordy. Strike a good balance between the two.
* Bad: data_structure, my_list, info_map, dictionary_for_the_purpose_of_storing_data_representing_word_definitions.
* Good: user_profile, menu_options, word_definitions.
* Don’t be a jackass and name things “O”, “l”, or “I”.
* When using CamelCase names, capitalize all letters of an abbreviation (e.g. HTTPServer).

**The main rule of naming convention is consistency.** If you are editing a file, follow the convention that is already used in that file. Additionally, if you are editing a project, follow the convention that is already used in that project.

**THE FILENAMES, FOLDER NAMES, VARIABLE NAMES, FUNCTION NAMES, CLASS NAMES, ENUMERATIONS AND CONSTANTS SHOULD ALWAYS STAND ON THEIR OWN. THEY SHOULD BE DESCRIPTIVE AND SHOULD NOT REQUIRE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS TO EXPLAIN THEMSELVES.**

### 1.1.1. File names

File names should be **all lowercase** and may include underscores (`_`) or dashes (`-`), but no additional punctuation. We prefer `_` Follow the convention that is already used in the template project.

e.g. `my_module.py`, `my_module_test.py`, `my_class_name.py`, `my_module_test.html`

### 1.1.2. Folder names

Folder names should be **all lowercase** and may include underscores (`_`) or dashes (`-`), but no additional punctuation. Follow the convention that is already used in the template project.

e.g. `my_folder`, `my_folder_test`

The name of the repository should only include `-` between the words and should not include spaces ` ` or underscores `_`.

### 1.1.3. Variable names

Variable names should be **all lowercase** and may include underscores (`_`), but no additional punctuation. Follow the convention that is already used in the template project.

e.g. `my_variable`, `my_variable_test`, `my_variable.py`, `my_variable_test.html`

### 1.1.4. Function names

Function names should be **all lowercase** and may include underscores (`_`), but no additional punctuation. Follow the convention that is already used in the template project.

e.g. `my_function`, `my_function_test`

### 1.1.5. Class names

Class names should follow the `UpperCamelCase` convention. Follow the convention that is already used in the template project.

e.g. `MyClass`, `MyClassTest`

### 1.1.6. Enumerations

Enumerations should be all **uppercase** and may include underscores (`_`), but no additional punctuation. Follow the convention that is already used in the template project.

e.g. `MY_ENUM`, `MY_ENUM_TEST`

### 1.1.7. Constants

Constants should be avoided if possible but if used it should be all **uppercase** and may include underscores (`_`), but no additional punctuation. Follow the convention that is already used in the template project.

e.g. `MY_CONSTANT`, `MY_CONSTANT_TEST`
