# Best Practices

## 1. Introduction

First of all the first three sections:

* [01 - Naming Conventions](01_naming_convention.md)
* [02 - Code Formatting](02_code_formatting.md)
* [03 - Code Organisation](03_code_organisation.md)

Are supposed to serve as guidelines for all the projects. Some of the elements are mandatory, some are optional. These guidelines are not set in stone, but they are a good starting point for all the projects.
 
The following sections present the coding process and the other good practices that should be followed and are within the R&D department guidelines.

## 2. Testing

The testing process is a very important part of the development process. In R&D testing and prototyping environment it is not mandatory (). It is important to test the code as much as possible. The testing process should be done in the following order:

* **Unit testing** - To use unit testing, the code should be written in a way that allows it. The code should be written in small, testable units. The unit tests should be written before the code is written. The unit tests should be written in a way that allows them to be run automatically.

To run unit tests take a look at the [Unit Testing](05_unit_testing.md) section.

We commit to do at least 2 unit tests for each function. 

## 3. Documentation

The documentation is not mandatory for R&D projects - prototyping, but when developing an application that will be run in production it has to be done. The documentation should be done in the following order:

**Code documentation** - The code should be documented in the following manner:
* **File documentation** - Each file should have documentation that describes the purpose of the file and the contents of the file. 
* **Function documentation** - Each function should have documentation that describes the purpose of the function and the parameters of the function. The documentation should also describe the return value of the function.
* **Class documentation** - Each class should have documentation that describes the purpose of the class and the contents of the class. The documentation should also describe the methods of the class.


## 4. Version Control

WIth library development, version control is a must. The version control should be done in the following order:

* **Committing** - The code should be committed in the following manner:
    * **Commit message** - Each commit should have a message that describes the purpose of the commit. The commit message should be written in the present tense. The commit message should be written in the imperative mood. It should be in English.
    * **Branching** - The code should be branched in the following manner:
        * **Branch name** - Can be the person working on it.
        * **Branch frequency** - The code should be branched in small chunks. The code should be branched in a way that allows it to be reviewed easily.
        * When the functionality is finished, the branch should be merged into the master branch.
    * **Commit frequency** - The code should be committed in small chunks. The code should be committed in a way that allows it to be reviewed easily.

## 5. Review Process

Aldoe the review process is not mandatory for R&D projects - prototyping, we commit to do it as ofter as possible. The review process is done in the following order:

* **Finished work** - When the work on a specific functionality is done this should be communicated to the team. The team should review the code and give feedback. The feedback should be given in a way that allows it to be reviewed easily.
* **Feedback** - The feedback should be given in a way that allows it to be reviewed easily. The feedback should be given in a way that allows it to be reviewed easily.
